# Philosophers

The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep

There are as many forks as philosophers

a philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand

When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. 

Once awake, they start thinking again

The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation

Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve

Philosophers don’t speak with each other

Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die

Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers

• Your(s) program(s) should take the following arguments:
    number_of_philosophers 
    time_to_die_
    time_to_eat_
    time_to_sleep
    [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
